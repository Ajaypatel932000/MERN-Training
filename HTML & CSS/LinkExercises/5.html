    <u> Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz and one of Silicon Valley’s</u> most respected and experienced 
     entrepreneurs, offers essential advice on building and running a startup—practical <i><b>wisdom</b></i>
      for managing the toughest problems business school doesn’t cover, based on his popular blog.

     every day, sharing the insights he’s gained developing, managing, selling, buying, 
     investing in, and supervising technology companies. A lifelong rap fanatic, he amplifies
     business lessons with <b><i>lyrics</i></b> from his favorite songs, telling it straight about
     everything from firing friends to poaching competitors, cultivating and sustaining a 
     CEO mentality to knowing the right time to cash in
