            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular
             point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the 
             syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used 
             to organize longer prose
